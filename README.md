# Sudoku-solver

A python program to solve any valid sudoku puzzle in under half a second.
Unfortunately, you need to input the sudoku values manually in the form of a list of list grid with empty spaces represented by 0.
Working on a mobile app version which will scan live cam footage for a sudoku grid to overlap the answer on the screen.
Would require custom trained cv running relatively light to support a mobile processing environment ; 
Or I could stream the live footage to a server which will do the processing, therefore releaving the stress from the mobile phone.

App coming soon. Any feedback / suggessions are welcome
